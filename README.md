# Is it payday?

I'm a little obsessed with creating simple applications in Javascript. In wanting to pratice using Javascript in functional ways, I created this webpage which answers the question of "Is it payday?". 

## But wait...
This website is purposely (for now) simple. Payday is assumed to be twice a month, on the 15th and 30th.
